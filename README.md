# Embodied sketches: Body and Language
Use your body to interact with words.

# The idea of the project
The scope of the project is a collaboration between body and mind. Movement and words. Humans use both tools in order to communicate with each other, and make clear what they want or not. Using computer vision a broad spectrum of experimentation arises while combining these tools. In this project two scripts are created in order to test a positive and a negative linguistic statement with our body. The scripts can be described as embodied sketches, since the collaboration of body and words are creating a visual output. Along with the aforementioned scripts, two more were created using the mouse instead of computer vision. The last two scripts aim to make the scripts accessible to more people.

Touch is a powerful and emotional action that can create both good and bad experiences. In the context of the project we are investigating the notion of touch, when it is unwanted. The notion of touch has become in the COVID-19 years rare and abstract. Through computer vision the project aims to activate the body movement, as the subject is “touching” digital objects. The question is what are our limits to touch? What happens when someone is stating “do not touch me”?



# Script II: Look at me

Some could say that eyes can also touch. Eyes also give away what our attention is sat on. When someone is asking for our gaze, they are looking for our attention. What do we do in such a case? Do we turn our heads to see what is there, or not?




# Inspiration
What served as an inspiration to the project was Maya Man and the Google Creative Lab’s project: “Body, Movement, Language: A.I. Sketches with Bill T. Jones”.  In this project art, technology, identity and body are explored when connected to each other. An interactive installation was created for the purpose of this project: “Naming Things: Approaching 21” with the guidance of the choreographer Bill T. Jones.

# Implementation 
Four scripts were created for the realization of this project. All of them were written on p5.js editor using p5.js which is a Javascript library. In terms of interaction, two of the scripts are working with the mouse while the other two are using posenet’s body detection.
